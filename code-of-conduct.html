<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

</header>

<section>


<h2>The Short Version</h2>

<p>
We expect every attendee to follow this document.
</p>

<p>
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave politely.
We consider harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes inappropriate.
Conference organizers may ask any attendees violating these rules to leave the
conference.
</p>

<p>In general, keep your talk material G-rated!</p>

<h2>The Longer Version</h2>

<p>

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

</p>

<p>
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior should comply immediately or
leave the event.
</p>

<p>
Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and
other exclusionary jokes can offend those around you. We consider excessive
swearing and offensive jokes inappropriate.
</p>

<p>
If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.
</p>

<h2>What to do if something happens</h2>

<p>
If you feel harassed, witness harassment, or have other concerns, please
contact a member of conference staff.
</p>

<p>
Conference staff will help participants contact security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your
attendance.
