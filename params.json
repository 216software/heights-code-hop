Show up and learn some cool stuff!\r\n\r\n## Want to help organize it?\r\n\r\nGreat!  There's a list of stuff to do here: https://github.com/216software/heights-code-hop/issues\r\n\r\n## Why you should show up\r\n\r\n*   Meet other programmers.  Make some new friends.  Meatspace friends!\r\n\r\n*   Scheme up some awesome business idea, or a more efficient algorithm,\r\n    or a fantastic open-source project.\r\n\r\n*   Help rookies get started.  Remember how frustrating it all was at\r\n    the beginning?  Now you need to give back, you moocher.\r\n\r\n*   Check out awesome restaurants and coffee shops and bakeries and bars\r\n    in Cleveland Heights.  This is a great town but it doesn't get much\r\n    attention.\r\n\r\n## Proposal guidelines\r\n\r\n### one third rookie talks\r\n\r\nA third of the talks should be accessible for beginners.  When I say\r\nbeginners, I mean somebody that maybe has never done anything beyond\r\nfill out a facebook profile.  So, I mean stuff like:\r\n\r\n*   This is HTML / CSS\r\n\r\n*   How to get started running a wordpress blog\r\n\r\n*   Should I start with Ruby, Python, PHP, Javascript?  This is all too\r\n    much?\r\n\r\n*   What the heck is the linux command line\r\n\r\n### two thirds everything else\r\n\r\nAfter that, for the other two thirds, let's talk about stuff anything\r\nrelated to open-source web technology.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I want talks like all the awesome ones I see at PyOhio,\r\nCode Mash, OSCON, etc.\r\n\r\nPlease, no promotional talks for paid products.\r\n\r\n## Venue: The beautiful Cleveland Heights Library \r\n\r\nhttp://heightslibrary.org/library-information/lee-road/\r\n\r\n## Date: April 30th, 2016\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct: TBD\r\n\r\n## How to register: TBD","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
