Heights Code Hop
++++++++++++++++

Conference in Cleveland Heights, OH focused on open-source web
programming.  Show up and learn some cool stuff!

Want to help organize it?
=========================

Great!  There's a list of stuff to do here: https://github.com/216software/heights-code-hop/issues


Why you should show up
======================

*   Meet other programmers.  Make some new friends.  Meatspace friends!

*   Scheme up some awesome business idea, or a more efficient algorithm,
    or a fantastic open-source project.

*   Help rookies get started.  Remember how frustrating it all was at
    the beginning?  Now you need to give back, you moocher.

*   Check out awesome restaurants and coffee shops and bakeries and bars
    in Cleveland Heights.  This is a great town but it doesn't get much
    attention.

Proposal guidelines
===================

one third rookie talks
----------------------

A third of the talks should be accessible for beginners.  When I say
beginners, I mean somebody that maybe has never done anything beyond
fill out a facebook profile.  So, I mean stuff like:

*   This is HTML / CSS

*   How to get started running a wordpress blog

*   Should I start with Ruby, Python, PHP, Javascript?  This is all too
    much?

*   What the heck is the linux command line

two thirds everything else
--------------------------

After that, for the other two thirds, let's talk about stuff anything
related to open-source web technology.

In other words, I want talks like all the awesome ones I see at PyOhio,
Code Mash, OSCON, etc.

Please, no promotional talks for paid products.

Venue: The Cleveland Heights Library
====================================

It's a beautiful facility, free for non-profits, and there's plenty of places
to walk to afterward.
